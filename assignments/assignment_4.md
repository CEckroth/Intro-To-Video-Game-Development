# Assignment 4: Exploring Game Programming Patterns

Everyone gets a break from coding assignments this weekend while we try something a bit different!

Over this last week, we discussed (and wrote code for) a player-controlled entity that implemented the **state** programming pattern. 
Hopefully you all feel a bit more familiar with its core ideas now and also see some of the benefits that (more) organized code brings to larger projects. 

In this assignment, your task is to read about one of the other programming patterns described in the online book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) and write up
your own condensed summary of the programming pattern described. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

 * Learn more deeply about a new programming pattern.
   * This is all about raw acquisition of information.
 * Digest the information learned and relate it to real-world examples.
   * This helps you retain the information learned.
 * Present the information you've learned to others.
   * This cements your knowledge of the topic, and gives you the chance to learn from classmates!
   
So I hope you understand that I'm not trying to give you busywork or something to rush through at the last minute. This is a really good opportunity to expand your knowledge, make sure that you make the most of it.

**To Do List:**

 * Read the [Introduction](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/introduction.html) and [Architecture, Performance, and Games](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/architecture-performance-and-games.html) chapters of [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html).
 * Select a (non-state) pattern from [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) to read and write about.
 * Post a message in the *homework discussion* channel in Discord (or send me an email) saying the pattern you've selected. 
   * Make sure yours is distinct from everyone else's!
 * Read your selected chapter.
 * Write a reflection / summary according to the requirements listed in **Deliverables**
 * Send your summary to me via email.
 
**Deliverables:** 1 text file named something like `<your_name_here>-assignment-4.txt` that is broken up into sections that address the following points:

 1. Describe the pattern your chapter was about.
    * Make sure to describe it so that your classmates that haven't read the chapter can get a high-level understanding of its purpose and general implementation strategy. 
 2. Everyone in this class has at least a few ideas for games they'd like to make someday, right? Explain how this pattern could be applied to some element of one of your own game ideas.
    * This may require some explaining of your game idea, which should be fun. Remember to not get too carried away, and keep things focused on the programming pattern overall.
    * If you can't think of how the programming pattern would apply to one of your future games, feel free to just describe any (original, not taken directly from the book) hypothetical game where the pattern would be useful.
 3. Show and discuss some (at least two) examples of elements of games where this pattern may have been used, or at least would have been useful in creating the end result we can see.
    * Give detail and depth with your examples so it is an understandable and useful example to people who haven't played the game before.
    * Links to videos of gameplay and/or screenshots are not required, but are definitely appreciated.

**Due Date:** 4/16/2018 (Monday) @ 5:30 PM (start of class). I recommend that you start reading early so you'll have time to let ideas cook before putting them on paper. 
My availability this weekend is somewhat limited, but I'll do my best to help with any questions that come up.

**Submission Instructions:** send an email with your summary attached to bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu

**Grading Criteria**
Grading criteria is as follows:

 * Your pattern was described well and thoroughly: 3 pts.
 * Provided an example where the discussed pattern would be applicable and useful: 3 pts.
 * Gave two examples of completed games that appear to use / benefit from the discussed pattern: 4 pts (2 for each example).
 
Up to two **bonus points** may be awarded for style, good writing, thoughtful responses, that sort of thing. 
To earn **bonus points**:

 * In the submission email, tell me honestly how many bonus points you think your response is worth.
 
 I won't automatically give you what you ask for, but it will give me some understanding of how far you think you pushed this assignment. Sorry about the subjective nature of this one,
 but I don't think putting hard limits (e.g. word count, etc.) would actually be conducive to thoughtful responses.

1 point will be deducted for each day that the assignment is late.
