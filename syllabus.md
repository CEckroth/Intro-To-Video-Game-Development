# CSC 303 - Introductory Video Game Development for Designers and Programmers
## Course Policy Statement - Spring 2017

**Office:** No campus office  
**Email:** Bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu  
**Office Hours:** By appointment. Send me an email and we'll work something out.  
**Course Web Site:** https://github.com/SamBumgardner/Intro-To-Video-Game-Development

### Course Description
Hands-on introduction to video game development, emphasizing the application of general computer science knowledge to the process of making video games.

### Lectures
Lectures will be M-W for the first 2 weeks. After that, Fridays will be a lab day
in Cheek 213 unless otherwise announced. See [attendance](#Attendance).

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, students should:

 1. Know and comfortably use git workflow through github.
 2. Have a solid understanding of the Haxe programming language and thoroughly understand differences and similarities between it and the other languages they know.
 4. Understand the purpose of a game engine.
 5. 
 6. 

### Textbooks
None.

### Attendance
Attendance in the class will account for 10% of your grade. I'll try to put all of our lecture notes into the class repository, but discussions and in-class exercises are hard to capture in a document. That, and not attending class generally isn't good for your students' understanding of the material. 

If you know you will have to miss a class in advance, then please let me know in an email and we'll work something out. 

If some terrible catastrophe caused you to miss a class, please also let me know in an email. My goal isn't to punish people for having bad luck, it's just to encourage everyone to give their best effort to get in the classroom on a regular basis.

### Tentative Outline



### Grading

Component                  | Percentage
-------------------------- | -------------------
Assignments and Exercises  | 40% (Drop 1 lowest)
Final Project              |                 30%
Attendance                 |                 10%

The assignment grading scheme drops the lowest score when determining the final score. It is expected that “ordinary” disasters such as accidentally misnamed files, network failures at the assignment due time, illness, etc. will be accommodated by these dropped grades. Additional extensions are not likely unless caused by “severe” disaster.

For the purposes of determining a grade for the course, the grades from exams, assignments, and projects will be combined as shown above. The course grade will be determined by totalling the score of all exams and assignments (minus lowest two assignment scores) and dividing it by the total possible score for the class. Letter grades will be assigned as follows:

 * 90% and above is an A
 * 80% and above is a B
 * 70% and above is a C
 * 60% and above is a D
 * below 60% is an F

The numeric requirements for letter grades may be lowered to reflect a curve but will not be raised.

An “W” grade for this course cannot be assigned after the [deadline in the academic calendar](http://calendar.missouristate.edu/viewevent.aspx?eventid=87835&occurrenceid=155456).

### Examinations
There will be none.

### Important Notes on Grading
The best way to improve your course grade is to submit assignments on time.
The best way to reduce your course grade is to not turn in assignments.
The due date will be given with each assignment. 
Late assignments will be penalized 10% for each calendar day after the due date.
All assignments and lab exercises may be completed using MSU-provided equipment and software or software available by download.

### Classroom Policies
#### Laptops, Tablets and Other Devices
Laptop computers, tablets or other devices are allowable for note-taking purposes only, provided that there are only minimal keyboard noises. If I believe that your device is in use for other than note-taking, or is more of a distraction than a benefit to you or to others, I will ask you to put it away. Laptops and PDAs must comply with the cell phone policy in their capability as a “communicative device.”

#### Cell Phones
As a member of the learning community, each student has a responsibility to other students
who are members of the community. When cell phones ring or receive other audible notifications and students respond in class or leave class to respond, it disrupts the class. Therefore, the Office of the Provost prohibits the use by students of cell phones, pagers, PDAs, or similar communication devices during scheduled classes. All such devices must be turned off or put in a silent (vibrate) mode and ordinarily should not be taken out during class. Given the fact that these same communication devices are an integral part of the University’s emergency notification system, an exception to this policy would occur when numerous devices activate simultaneously. When this occurs, students may consult their devices to determine if a university emergency exists. If that is not the case, the devices should be immediately returned to silent mode and put away. Other exceptions to this policy may be granted at the discretion of the instructor.

### University Policies
#### Academic Integrity
Missouri State University is a community of scholars committed to developing educated persons who accept the responsibility to practice personal and academic integrity. You are responsible for knowing and following the university’s student honor code, [Student Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures](http://www.missouristate.edu/policy/Op3_01_AcademicIntegrityStudents.htm) and also available at the Reserves Desk in Meyer Library. Any student participating in any form of academic dishonesty will be subject to sanctions as described in this policy.

#### Nondiscrimination
Missouri State University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action institution, and maintains a grievance procedure available to any person who believes he or she has been discriminated against. At all times, it is your right to address inquiries or concerns about possible discrimination to the Office for Institutional Equity and Compliance, Park Central Office Building, 117 Park Central Square, Suite 111, (417) 836-4252. Other types of concerns (i.e., concerns of an academic nature) should be discussed directly with your instructor and can also be brought to the attention of your instructor’s Department Head. Please visit the OED website at www.missouristate.edu/equity/.

Students are required to provide documentation of disability to the Disability Resource Center prior to receiving accommodations. The Disability Resource Center refers some types of accommodation requests to the Learning Diagnostic Clinic, which also provides diagnostic testing for learning and psychological disabilities.
