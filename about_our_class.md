# About Our Class

As a class exercise, we will each use git and GitHub to add our own little autobiography to this file!

## Example_Name 
Hello, I'm Example_Name, and I came to school to learn how to tie my shoes!

### Garren Ijames
Garren Ijames is a Computer Science student at Missouri State. Currently he is enrolled in "Introduction to Video Game Development".
Most importantly, he enjoys Reeses peanut-butter cups.

## Cameron Yuan
I'm Cameron. I like to sleep, play video games, and play ultimate frisbee.
I like strategy, survival, and RPG games the best. In my free time I like to sleep and play ultimate frisbee. 
I'm having trouble with Git.

## Jess Geiger
Cat enthusiast, video game lover, motorcycle rider.
Appreciates Andy's custard, Hurts donuts, the Oxford comma, and long walks on the beach.
Moving to Wichita after graduation for a job with Koch Industries, and just got approved for my apartment 3-22.

## Woollums_Dillon
Hello, I'm Dillon Woollums, an undergraduate senior in Computer Science here at Missouri State University. 
I'm here to learn how to apply computer science and game design principles to actually making a game. 
Some of my favorite games are Portal 2, Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal, Final Fantasy 7, and F-Zero GX.

## Keith Cissell
Hello, I'm Keith Cissell, and I am studying computer science with a goal to aid space research 
and exploration. I am mostly interested in artificial intelegence and robotics. Ideally, I want to 
create a robot that is able to scout out planets / clusters to find resources and habitable areas.

## Mark Godsy
Hello, I'm Mark Godsy, and I love video games! I came to Missouri State to study Computer Science
and will graduate this semester. My favorite types of video games are RPGs, which includes aRPGs(Diablo),
 cRPGs(Baldur's Gate/Pillars of Eternity), and jRPG's(Final Fantasy, Persona). I am currently playing through Persona 4 and loving it!

## Caleb Breslin
The dream has always been to be involved in game design. Computer Science is just a starting point for me. 
Enrolled in this class expecting to learn the Unreal Engine, but I'm interested to see what Haxe holds in
store. Absolute favorite game has to be Uncharted 3, but I'm in love with the entire franchise.

## Trenton Nale
Not much to tell:  Sophomore in the CompSci program, love reading and a pretty broad array of games, and I
enrolled in this class because I hoped ot learn some principles that might benefit me if I ever get around
to actually building one of the dozens of game ideas I have rolling around.  One unusual bit is that I am
getting a minor in Philosophy as well.
