Woollums_Dillon
Hello, I'm Dillon Woollums, an undergraduate senior in Computer Science here at Missouri State University. I'm here to learn how to apply computer science and game design principles to actually making a game. Some of my favorite games are Portal 2, Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal, Final Fantasy 7, and F-Zero GX.
